# Employee Management System

A Django-based Employee Management System that allows administrators to manage employees, assign roles, and configure permissions. The application leverages Django's built-in groups and permissions for role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Uses Django's authentication system with custom roles (`Admin` and `Employee`).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Allows role-based access to different features and views.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD support for managing employee records.
- **Custom User Model**: Extends Djangoâ€™s `AbstractUser` to include custom roles.
- **Clean and Responsive UI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing employees and their roles.

Usage
Managing Roles and Permissions
Admin Access: Use the Django admin interface to create groups and assign permissions to each group.
Assigning Roles: Users can have a role in the custom User model (either admin or employee).
Automatic Group Assignment: Users are automatically assigned to groups based on their role, allowing specific access rights.
Custom Permissions
You can add custom permissions in the Employee model via the Meta class:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    permissions = [
        ("can_view_salary", "Can view employee salary"),
        ("can_edit_position", "Can edit employee position"),
    ]
Role Management Interface
The UI includes options to:

Edit and delete roles.
View all assigned permissions for each role.
Create new roles directly from the interface.
